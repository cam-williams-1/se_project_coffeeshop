# SE Project Coffeeshop

## This web design implements html blocks with css styles that color, organize, and animate the information about the Triple Peaks Coffeeshop! You can look at our menu, book a table, and find our social media links!

### I plan on improving this project with revealed photos of the coffee shop and some latte art from the baristas that appear when hovered over the menu items - using z-index and the hover pseudo class.

### Here is a quick link to what the project looks like at the moment! :)
